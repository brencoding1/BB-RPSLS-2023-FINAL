# Testing

Overall the website is a very clear, clean and easily navigateable website. The game works seamlessly and users of all ages can interact and use this game with ease. All buttons work when clicked and perfom the task they were assigned to do. The colours of the site are clear and distinctive and are purposly implimented to make evrthing easy for the user to identify.

The website works well on all browsers and devices. When shrunkin down it adapts perfectly to mobile size and can be used and read just as easily as when it is in desktop mode.

Some bugs I encountered are that although it all details load perfectly across all devices and are clear and usable to the user, the positions of some of the icons and sections on the site dont lay out perfectly on some devices, which make the game look not as asthetic to the eye as it would on a laptop or tablet. This is noticable mostly on the score section of the game. Thankfully it is only very specific devices this occurs on such as the iPad mini and the Surface Pro 7 which are attached below. 

* iPad Mini:

* Surface Pro 7:
